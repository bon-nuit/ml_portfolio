# ml_portfolio
Portfolio of various ML / AI projects as I have time. Most of these were school projects that were lost when my hard drive crashed.

I've hopefully improved my engineering skills since then.

[] Decision Trees
    - Mostly done. Works for categorical variable types. Implements the ID3 algorithm. 
    - TODO: 
        [] add visualization
        [] unit tests to validate I don't make breaking changes
        [] binning for continuous valued variables.
[] Naive Bayes
[] Log regression
[] Bag / Boost
[] Feature selection
